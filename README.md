# TilePlacerJava
This program is an algorithm that places L tiles on a board leaving only one missing cell. The program takes inputs from the args String array on execution for the size of the grid and the x and y coordinates of the missing cell. It then uses recursion to fill every other cell with L tiles.

This program was made as an assignment for a COP3337 class.
